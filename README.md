# Advent of Code 2021
This is my first time doing Advent of Code, and I've started late. I started on January 1 
instead of December 1. To stay in the spirit of AoC, I'll only attempt one puzzle per day.

I chose to use CLion instead of the usual vim or VSCode, hence the use of cmake instead of 
rolling my own Makefile. (CLion _really likes_ cmake.) I don't really like using cmake for such a 
small project, but I don't like fighting CLion more.
